# Gally Launcher!

Gally Launcher is a Minecraft Launcher but in CLI (Command Line Interface). There is no GUI (Graphic User Interface) or any window interactible.

## Disclaimer
I am not a Minecraft developer. I just made the launcher I always wanted to have. Any request from Minecraft related companies to remove my code will be granted. 

## Installation
### Using Python (Windows 10/Linux)


Use git and clone [gally_launcher](https://github.com/coni/gally_launcher)

```
git clone https://github.com/coni/gally_launcher
```

### On Windows 10 without Python
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/coni/gally_launcher/releases/download/latest/gally_launcher-win64.exe), then use it! (It's better with cmd.exe)

## Usage  
I highly recommend using Gally Launcher with a terminal such as cmd.exe or any other Linux terminal. If you don't know how to use a terminal, I suggest you look for guides on the Internet. It is really important to know the basics of a terminal.

### Exemple
To simply start Minecraft with "coni" as username in 1.16.5
```bash
gally_launcher -u coni -v 1.16.5
```  
or if you use Python
```bash
python3 __main__.py -u coni -v 1.16.5
```

to know every possibility of my launcher
```bash
gally_launcher --help
```
